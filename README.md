## 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains the following features:

| Feature     | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `age`       | Age of the patient |
| `sex`       | 1 = Male, 0 = Female |
| `cp`        | Chest pain type (0–3 categories) |
| `trestbps`  | Resting blood pressure |
| `chol`      | Serum cholesterol (mg/dl) |
| `fbs`       | Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false) |
| `restecg`   | Resting electrocardiographic results |
| `thalach`   | Maximum heart rate achieved |
| `exang`     | Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no) |
| `oldpeak`   | ST depression induced by exercise |
| `slope`     | Slope of the peak exercise ST segment |
| `ca`        | Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy |
| `thal`      | 3 = Normal, 6 = Fixed defect, 7 = Reversible defect |
| `target`    | 1 = Heart disease, 0 = No heart disease |

## 📈 Model Used

We use **Logistic Regression**, which is ideal for binary classification tasks like predicting the presence or absence of heart disease. It’s interpretable, beginner-friendly, and performs well with small datasets.

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

We evaluate our model using:
- **Accuracy** – Overall correctness of the model
- **Confusion Matrix** – Counts of true/false positives/negatives
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score** – Performance across classes

These metrics help ensure the model works reliably and avoids false alarms in health predictions.
